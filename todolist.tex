Great question 👍 you’ve come very far already. Let’s step back and build a **clear todo list** so you know exactly what’s left to make your backend API feature-complete and production-ready.

---

# ✅ What You Already Have

* **Database Schema (Prisma)** with:

  * `User`, `Project`, `Partner`, `Event`, `News`, `ContactMessage`, `Media`
* **Repositories → Services → Controllers → Routes** for:

  * `User`, `Project`, `Partner`, `Event`, `ContactMessage` (done)
* **Media handling**: URL uploads and **file uploads with Multer** (local disk).
* **Seeding script** with sample data (admin user, example projects, etc).
* **Express app** with error handling, middlewares (helmet, cors, compression).

# 📝 Todo List (Remaining Work)

### 1. **News Module**

* [ ] Repository, Service, Controller, Routes (CRUD) for `News`
* [ ] Endpoints:

  * `GET /api/news` → list all news
  * `GET /api/news/slug/:slug` → fetch by slug (for frontend blog pages)
  * `POST /api/news` → create (admin only)
  * `PUT /api/news/:id` → update
  * `DELETE /api/news/:id` → delete
* [ ] Attach media (images, videos) to news articles

---

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

* [ ] Register / Login endpoints with JWT
* [ ] `authMiddleware` verifies token
* [ ] Role-based access (`ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `USER`)
* [ ] Protect create/update/delete routes (projects, news, events, partners, media, messages)

---

### 3. **Validation Layer**

* [ ] Add request validation with **Zod** or **Joi** (example: email format, required fields)
* [ ] Return structured 400 errors instead of generic ones

---

### 4. **Media Enhancements**

* [ ] Delete file from `/uploads/media` when media record is deleted
* [ ] Add support for **avatars** (`/uploads/avatars`) for users
* [ ] Prepare config for switching storage to **Cloudinary/S3**

---

### 5. **Admin Dashboard Support**

* [ ] Pagination + search in list endpoints (already scaffolded in repos, test all)
* [ ] Sort by `createdAt` / `order` fields where relevant
* [ ] Return consistent response format:

  ```json
  {
    "data": [...],
    "meta": { "page": 1, "limit": 10, "total": 50 }
  }
  ```

---

### 6. **Error Handling**

* [ ] Improve error messages in `errorHandler` (map Prisma errors, e.g. unique constraint violations)
* [ ] Add 404 handling for missing routes

---

### 7. **Security / Production Setup**

* [ ] Store passwords hashed (already using bcrypt in seed, make sure in auth too)
* [ ] Add `dotenv` config for:

  * `JWT_SECRET`
  * `DATABASE_URL`
  * `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  * `UPLOAD_DIR` (optional)
* [ ] Set correct **CORS** origin (`http://localhost:5173` for dev, your frontend domain for prod)

---

### 8. **Testing**

* [ ] Postman collection for all endpoints
* [ ] Write Jest tests for services (optional but recommended)

---

### 9. **Docs**

* [ ] Swagger setup (already scaffolded, but add models + endpoints)
* [ ] README with instructions: install, migrate, seed, run

---

# 🚀 Optional Nice-to-Have

* [ ] Email notification when new `ContactMessage` is created
* [ ] Logging with Winston / pino instead of console
* [ ] Background jobs (BullMQ) if needed for heavy tasks
* [ ] API versioning (`/api/v1/...`)

👉 If you want, I can prepare the **next concrete step** for you: building the **News module** (repo, service, controller, routes, and example JSON). That way your frontend can start pulling articles.

Would you like me to write the News module next, in the same style as Project/Partner/Event?
